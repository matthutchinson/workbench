## My Workbench

My own vim folder, dotfiles and handy scripts.
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used for vim plugins.  You can
install (or refresh) symlinks to the workbench with;

```
$ cd workbench
$ ./bin/benchpress
```

### The Toolbelt

* Vim
* Tmux
* Tmuxinator
* Bash aliasy, bash_profile
* ZSH profile and config
* Dot files for ctags, ack, ag, rsync, synergy, rails, irb, gems and more
* Global git hooks and custom merges

### Tmux

The `tmux/` directory contains various segments for my tmux status bar, and a
custom theme. It all comes together to look something like this;

### Disclaimer

I change and commit to this toolbox regularly.  In some rare occasions it might
be in a broken state.  If you intend to use this repository yourself, its
probably better if you fork it.
